# Trivia Game

A short trivia game with a Final Fantasy theme. The game is built purely as a front end application,
using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine.

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/wparks08/TriviaGame
```

### Prerequisites

All you need is a browser! Since this is a pure front-end application, you don't need
any tools, frameworks, or package managers. Once the game is on your machine, simply open `index.html` in the project root.

## Deployment

Any basic web server will do. Just make sure `index.html` is all that needs to be served to the client.

## Built With

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com) - Used for DOM manipulation
